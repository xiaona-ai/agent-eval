Global sea level rise is measured in millimeters per year, not inches per hour. This is a clear nonsensical / fabricated claim.\n\n5. While the agent superficially provided a weather report, it included at least one blatantly absurd statement ('sea level is rising at 3 inches per hour') that destroys any credibility.
